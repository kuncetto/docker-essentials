# Docker Editions

Docker is available in two editions:

+ Docker Community Edition
+ Docker Enterprise Edition

## Docker Community Edition (CE)

[Docker CE](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop) is the open-source freely available edition supported by the community. It contains the Docker engine, built-in orchestration, networking and security. It provides a great hands-on experience to start testing, training and learning Docker.

## Docker Enterprise Edition (EE)

[Docker EE](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-enterprise) is recommended for production environments and it is supported by Docker if compliant with the [Docker Compatibility Matrix](https://success.docker.com/article/compatibility-matrix). A one month free trial period is available for product evaluation.
